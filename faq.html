<h2>1. What is MindFlux AI and why was it created?</h2>
<p>
MindFlux AI is a practical AI tools platform designed to help people think more clearly in everyday situations.
It was created to address a growing problem in the AI space: many tools are either too technical, too aggressive,
or too vague to be genuinely useful for normal users.
</p>
<p>
The goal of MindFlux AI is not to overwhelm users with features or promises.
Instead, it focuses on clarity, simplicity, and thoughtful design.
Every tool on this platform is built to support human decision-making,
not replace it.

have considered.
